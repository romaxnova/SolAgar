# Agar.io Clone with Solana & USDC Integration - Final Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a fork of the open-source Agar.io clone enhanced with Solana blockchain integration and USDC cryptocurrency support. The implementation allows players to deposit USDC to play, tracks player value in USDC, and provides a withdrawal mechanism with fee logic.

## Features Implemented
- Solana-based custodial wallets for each player
- USDC deposit requirement (1 USDC per game)
- Player value tracked in USDC based on mass
- Withdrawal mechanism (from 5 USDC with a 1% fee after 10 USDC)
- Locked liquidity on entry into global game session
- Complete backend and frontend integration

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
1. **Node.js/Express Server**
   - API endpoints for wallet operations
   - Game server integration
   - Socket.io for real-time communication

2. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Users table for wallet information
   - Transactions table for deposit/withdrawal history

3. **Solana Integration**
   - Wallet creation and management
   - USDC token operations
   - Transaction verification
   - Fee logic implementation

### Frontend Components
1. **Game Client**
   - Original Agar.io gameplay
   - Wallet connection interface
   - USDC balance display
   - Deposit and withdrawal UI

2. **Webpack Configuration**
   - Asset bundling
   - Development and production builds

3. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Static file hosting
   - Environment variable configuration

## Implementation Details

### Solana Wallet Operations
The system creates custodial wallets for players, storing encrypted private keys securely in the database. Each wallet can receive USDC deposits and process withdrawals with the appropriate fee logic.

```javascript
// Wallet creation
const keypair = Keypair.generate();
const publicKey = keypair.publicKey.toString();
const privateKey = bs58.encode(keypair.secretKey);
const encryptedPrivateKey = encryptPrivateKey(privateKey);
```

### USDC Integration
The game uses the USDC token on Solana Devnet for all monetary operations. Players must deposit 1 USDC to start playing, and their in-game value is tracked based on their mass.

```javascript
// Fee logic for withdrawals
function calculateWithdrawalAmount(amount) {
  if (amount > 10) {
    const fee = amount * 0.01;
    return {
      withdrawalAmount: amount - fee,
      fee
    };
  }
  return {
    withdrawalAmount: amount,
    fee: 0
  };
}
```

### Game Logic Modifications
The original Agar.io game logic was modified to track player value in USDC, update the global liquidity pool, and handle deposit/withdrawal operations.

```javascript
// Update player value based on mass
player.gameValue = player.massTotal * 0.001; // 1000 mass = 1 USDC
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  public_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  private_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  balance NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
  session_id TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('deposit', 'withdrawal')),
  amount NUMERIC,
  status TEXT,
  tx_signature TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Backend (Render)
The backend is configured for deployment on Render with the following settings:
- Node.js environment
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Environment variables for Solana and USDC configuration
- Health check endpoint

### Frontend (Vercel)
The frontend is configured for deployment on Vercel with the following settings:
- Static file hosting
- Environment variables for backend API URL
- Build process using webpack

## User Guide

### Getting Started
1. Visit the game website
2. Enter your name in the input field
3. Click "Connect Wallet" to create or connect to your Solana wallet
4. Deposit 1 USDC to start playing
5. Click "Play" to enter the game

### Gameplay
- Control your cell with your mouse
- Eat food (small colored dots) to grow
- Eat smaller players to grow faster
- Avoid larger players who can eat you
- Your in-game value is tracked in USDC based on your mass

### Withdrawing Funds
1. After playing and growing your cell, you can withdraw your earnings
2. Minimum withdrawal amount is 5 USDC
3. Withdrawals over 10 USDC incur a 1% fee
4. Enter the amount and destination address
5. Click "Withdraw" to process the transaction

## Testing Results
The application has been thoroughly tested to ensure all components work correctly:
- Wallet connection functionality ✅
- Deposit interface ✅
- Withdrawal interface with fee logic ✅
- USDC balance display ✅
- Game integration with Solana ✅

## Future Enhancements
- JWT Auth or Magic.Link for user login
- Leaderboards and ranking by USDC
- Smart contract escrow system for global liquidity
- On-chain rewards and badges using NFTs
- Analytics + fraud prevention dashboard

## Conclusion
The monetized Agar.io clone with Solana and USDC integration has been successfully implemented according to the requirements. The application provides a seamless gaming experience with blockchain integration, allowing players to earn and withdraw cryptocurrency based on their gameplay performance.
