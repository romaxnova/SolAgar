# User Guide: Agar.io Clone with Solana & USDC Integration

This guide will help you navigate and enjoy our Agar.io clone with Solana blockchain and USDC cryptocurrency integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended)
- Phantom Wallet browser extension (for Solana interactions)
- Some USDC on Solana Devnet for testing

### Accessing the Game
1. Visit the game website at [game-url.com](https://game-url.com)
2. You'll see the main game screen with options to connect your wallet and play

## Connecting Your Wallet

1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button on the main screen
2. If you have Phantom Wallet installed, it will prompt you to connect
3. Approve the connection request in your wallet
4. Once connected, your wallet address will be displayed and the "Deposit" button will become available

## Depositing USDC to Play

1. After connecting your wallet, click the "Deposit 1 USDC to Play" button
2. Phantom Wallet will open with a transaction request for 1 USDC
3. Review and approve the transaction
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Solana network
5. Once confirmed, your wallet balance will update and you'll be able to play

## Playing the Game

1. Enter your nickname in the text field
2. Click the "Play" button to start the game
3. Control your cell by moving your mouse - your cell will follow the cursor
4. Eat food (small colored dots) to grow your cell
5. Eat smaller players to grow faster
6. Avoid larger players who can eat you
7. Your current USDC value is displayed in the top-right corner
8. The global liquidity pool is also displayed, showing the total USDC in the game

### Game Controls
- **Mouse Movement**: Direct your cell
- **Space Bar**: Split your cell (when large enough)
- **W Key**: Eject mass (can be used to feed other players)

## Understanding Your USDC Value

- Your in-game value is calculated based on your cell's mass
- The conversion rate is approximately 1000 mass = 1 USDC
- Your value increases as you eat food and other players
- Your value decreases if you are eaten by other players
- The minimum withdrawal amount is 5 USDC

## Withdrawing Your Earnings

1. After playing and accumulating at least 5 USDC, you can withdraw your earnings
2. Click on your username or the wallet icon to access the withdrawal menu
3. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw (minimum 5 USDC)
4. Enter the destination Solana wallet address
5. Click "Withdraw" to initiate the transaction
6. Approve the transaction in your wallet

### Fee Structure
- Withdrawals of 10 USDC or less: No fee
- Withdrawals over 10 USDC: 1% fee
- Example: Withdrawing 15 USDC will result in a 0.15 USDC fee, so you'll receive 14.85 USDC

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Connection Issues
- Make sure Phantom Wallet is installed and unlocked
- Try refreshing the page and connecting again
- Check that you're on the correct network (Devnet for testing)

### Transaction Failures
